# Unity Game Development


## What you built? 

I love to game and have always wanted to learn about game engines, so I decided to start
learning the Unity game engine.  I started by building a simple Lego tutorial game, which
took up a fair amount of time due to my unfamiliarity with game engine programming, but got
me familiar with the Unity Editor.  After that, I decided to get a little more experience
following a basic platformer tutorial and personalizing that game.  Lastly, I wanted to
try my hand at creating a 2D game from scratch (interactive map) and experience the 
difference between building a game from scratch rather than using pre-loaded assets.

## Who Did What?
I did this alone

## What you learned

I really enjoyed the initial building of games like the two tutorials provided for me, 
especially when I had all the tedious work done for me, such as modeling the characters, 
programming all the animations for me, and the basic setup of linking cameras through 
scripts.  However, when I started to really delve into making my own game, I was quickly 
bogged down with the work of creating/looking for assets that I wanted to use as well as 
looking up how to do small details such as linking the cursor to the camera and dealing
with layers.  And this was with my focus on 2D games rather than 3D games, which are more 
complex. I could barely figure out the camera.  I now see why making games is so exhausting 
and a lot of game developers need so much time to create as advanced as games as they do.  I 
think that game developing would be an awesome idea for a project, but this Hack-a-Thing 
really got me thinking about what the scope of such a project would be.  I could easily see 
it feasible to create projects that turn boring situations into simple, game-like scenarios, 
but would find it difficult to think that creating any game that is even close to industry 
standards would be impossible to do in this course.  I would not mind doing more game development 
on my project and could see a project that might tackle a social issue, I was thinking 
reporting misleading articles, turned into an accessible, being turned into some type of game format.
