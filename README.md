# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I love to game and have always wanted to learn about game engines, so I decided to start
learning the Unity game engine.  I started by building a simple Lego tutorial game, which
took up a solid amount of time seeing as it was a bunch of fun.  After that, I decided to
try my hand at creating a 2D game from scratch and see experience the difference of 
building a game from scratch rather than using pre-loaded assets.

## Who Did What?

Sean Simons did everything (I did this alone)

## What you learned

I really enjoyed the initial building of a game, especially when I had all the tedious
work done for me, such as modeling the characters and programming all the animations for
me.  However, when I started to really delve into making my own game, I was quickly bogged
down with the work of creating/looking for assets that I wanted to use as well as looking
up how to do small details.  I now see why making games is so exhausting and a lot of
workers have become overworked at game studios which have strict deadlines.
